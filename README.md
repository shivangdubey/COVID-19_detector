# COVID-19_detector
The project aims to classify positive and negative cases of COVID-19 from lung X-rays using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier and optimizing the model using gradient descent. The project involves training the CNN model on a large dataset of COVID-19 positive and negative lung X-rays to accurately classify new X-rays into positive or negative cases. Gradient descent optimization technique is used to minimize the cost function and improve the model's accuracy. The trained model can be used for quick and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 using X-ray images, especially in areas with limited access to PCR tests. The project can be of significant use to the healthcare industry and can assist in early detection and timely management of COVID-19 cases.
