# COVID-19_detector
The project's goal is to use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier to classify positive and negative COVID-19 cases from lung X-rays, and then optimise the model using gradient descent. The project entails training the CNN model on a large dataset of COVID-19 positive and negative lung X-rays in order to accurately classify new X-rays. To minimise the cost function and improve the model's accuracy, the gradient descent optimization technique is used. The trained model can be used to quickly and accurately diagnose COVID-19 using X-ray images, especially in areas where PCR tests are unavailable. The project has the potential to benefit the healthcare industry by assisting in the early detection and management of COVID-19 cases.
